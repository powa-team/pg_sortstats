	 *
	 * Initially, all the slots are kept in a linked list of free slots.  When
	 * a tuple is read from a tape, it is put to the next available slot, if
	 * it fits.  If the tuple is larger than SLAB_SLOT_SIZE, it is palloc'd
	 * instead.
	 *
	 * When we're done processing a tuple, we return the slot back to the free
	 * list, or pfree() if it was palloc'd.  We know that a tuple was
	 * allocated from the slab, if its pointer value is between
